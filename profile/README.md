# Fusion & Perception Group
<p align="left">Welcome to the Fusion & Perception Group's GitHub presence, where we tackle tech with all the enthusiasm of a coffee-deprived robot, or a drone with acrophobia!</p>

## üßê About Us
At Fusion & Perception Group, we're that group of folks who look at drones, interactions, and robots and think, "Hmmm, what if?" 
- **Drones**: We mess around with flying gadgets that are sometimes more reliable than your Wi-Fi.
- **Interactions**: We make your computer feel less like a machine and more like that friend who never texts back on time.
- **Robotics**: It's like playing with really expensive Lego sets, but with more wires and screws. So it's more painful when you step onto them.

## üî¨ What We Do
- **Research**: We do some serious sciencing here. Flying hair clippers can clip more than hair when it's not seriously implemented!
- **Open Source**: Because sharing is caring, and also because our code is too embarrassing to keep to ourselves. Though most of the time it's the opposite.
- **Collaboration**: We enjoy teaming up with anyone who can tolerate our occasional nerdy jokes/overdued works/missing contact.

## üåê Connect with Us
We'd say "Follow us or else," but we're not that intense. Connect with us on...GitHub only. At least for now.

## ü´† About our name
If you don't know what kind of "fusion" we are talking about, it's "confusion".
